##Note: 
The ultimate goal is to set up a front end framework work together with a backend framework. Based on the following reading, and the goal of the project (visualization using webgl and react), at this moment, it seems a ReactJS+Redux front end + Django RESTful backend is a good choice. Whether maintain the state of the UI in front end or backend remains in question.

 * [Lessons learned from buildout a django site with a reactjs front-end](http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2015/08/31/django-site-with-javascript-frontend.html)
 * [Scalable Data Vis with React & D3](https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/3-steps-scalable-data-visualization-react-js-d3-js)

At this moment, run django by development server, may need to deploy it to a real production web server(Apache or Ngnix) is future step.
